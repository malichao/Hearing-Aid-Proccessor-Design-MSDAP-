# Hearing Aid Proccessor Design(MSDAP)
This is a course project of ASIC.MSDAP(Mini Stereo Digital Audio Processor) is a low-cost, low-power and application specific mini stereo digital audio processor used in a hearing aid.The main function of this processor is a two-channel, 256 order, finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter.It receives 16 bits voice data(sampled at 48 kHz) and computes the FIR result at the speed of 26.88MHz.Right now itâ€™s designed in both behavioral level and RTL level.  

A detailed decription of this project is available on my blog [here](http://lichaoma.com/2015/11/15/mini-stereo-digital-audio-processor-msdap/).
